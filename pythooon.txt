	PTHYTON :
       ============
1) constants ,
2)reserved words : ex : nonoe ,is,if ,..
3)variables : dont tend to use variables with under scores in pyhton .
              don't us e :=====>>> (.)
              and note that it is not a good practice to use uppercases for differentiating variables;
4)Mnemonic variable Names : means that we can use any name of the variable that does make sense with what you are doing and it can help reader to know what you are doing  .

	Expressions:
        =============
a)numeric expression : operator = + , -, * , / , **(power) , % (modulus)
b)order of evaluation :  paranthesis   -> power -> multiplication ->addition -> the re pf the calculation 


SOMe commands : 
-----------------
           1) type(variableName or a string )
       ==>returns the type of variable = > ex : <class 'str'>meaning the variable is a string ;
           2)CASTING : changing from one data type to the other . ex :>>> i = 1
                                                                      >>>print(float(i)) // output 1.0  ,here we have changed integer to float .
			casting from string to interger ex: >>> x ='123'
							    >>> x= int(x)
			Ss				    >>> print (x) // 123
 			BUT this does not work  ==> x= 'innocent'
						>>> print(int(x));//value EROOR
          3)INPUT : take the users inputs : name = input ('A word to prompt the user "0;
